To create a clone of this file, you need to read its contents and write them into a new file. In Python, this can be done using the open() function. First, open the original file, "log.txt", in read mode and store its contents. Then, create a new file, such as "log_clone.txt", and write the same contents into it. This ensures that the new file is an exact duplicate of the original. Using Pythonâ€™s shutil.copy() method is another efficient way to copy files with a single command. Cloning a file helps in backup, duplication, and further modifications without affecting the original file.
