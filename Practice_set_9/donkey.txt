The ###### walks across the hill,
Where grasses #####, and trees stand still.
A ######’s pace is slow and sure,
With steps that wander, pure, demure.

The ######’s eyes look far and wide,
A world unknown on every side.
A ######’s ###### light as air,
Yet heavy thoughts are always there.

A ###### rests beneath the shade,
While dreams of far-off lands are laid.
A ######'s ##### is strong and kind,
With gentle spirit, never blind.

The ######'s bray, it fills the air,
A sound of freedom everywhere.
The ###### knows no fear or pride,
Just simple truths that never hide.

A ######’s journey never ends,
For each new ####, the path extends.
Through hills and valleys, far and near,
The ###### walks without a fear.
