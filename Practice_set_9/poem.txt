Through jungle paths so wide and free,
A mighty elephant walks with glee.
With ears like fans and steps so grand,
The wisest soul in all the land.

His trunk, a tool so strong yet kind,
Lifts up a friend who's left behind.
Splashing water, cool and bright,
In golden sun, a joyful sight.

He sways beneath the banyan tall,
Where little birds and echoes call.
His tusks like ivory moons so bright,
Glowing softly in the light.

He guards the herd, both young and old,
A leader brave, yet never cold.
Through storms and heat, through dusk and dawn,
His love for them goes on and on.

The river bends, the trees all sway,
He marches forth, no need to stray.
The jungle whispers, soft and low,
"Great elephant, we love you so."

His heart is big, his soul is wise,
A friend to earth, beneath wide skies.
No hunter’s greed, nor human hand,
Should steal his peace or claim his land.

Oh, let him roam where he belongs,
In nature’s arms, in nature’s songs.
For elephants are meant to be,
Wild and strong, forever free.
